# Devmatch The Graph Workshop

## ðŸš€ Workshop Navigation Guide

This repository is structured into branches that represent **checkpoints** in the workshop.  
Each branch contains a different stage of the codebase so you can follow along at your own pace.

| 0    | [`main`](https://github.com/SohZHong/devmatch-workshop/blob/main)                         | Complete Code                             |
| 1    | [`checkpoint-one`](https://github.com/SohZHong/devmatch-workshop/blob/checkpoint-one)     | First setup / initial code                |
| 2    | [`checkpoint-two`](https://github.com/SohZHong/devmatch-workshop/blob/checkpoint-two)     | Core feature implementation begins        |
| 3    | [`checkpoint-three`](https://github.com/SohZHong/devmatch-workshop/blob/checkpoint-three) | Mid-workshop progress                     |
| 4    | [`checkpoint-four`](https://github.com/SohZHong/devmatch-workshop/blob/checkpoint-four)   | Multiple protocol queries                 |
| 5    | [`checkpoint-five`](https://github.com/SohZHong/devmatch-workshop/blob/checkpoint-five)   | Final solution / reference implementation |

### ðŸ“Œ How to Switch Branches

You can switch to any branch by using the GitHub branch selector (top-left dropdown on this page),  
or by running this in your terminal:

```bash
git fetch
git checkout checkpoint-2   # Replace with desired checkpoint
```
